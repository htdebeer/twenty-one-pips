# A JavaScript Dice Library for Creating Dice Games and other Educational Purposes

Twenty-one-pips is a JavaScript *dice library* to render and control dice. I
intend it for educational purposes, as a simple, well-known, yet meaningful
context for novices to explore programming concepts in an introductory
programming course. As a context it is also suited for basic mathematics, early
introductions to probability and statistics. 

It is still very much under development and there has been no release yet.
